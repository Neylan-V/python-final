########## WHAT AM I DOING??????
# what functions?
# what main body?
# ...classes?
  # maybe the whole GAME is a class?
  # ok maybe not, based on the wheel of python reading, but the players could be classes?
    # maybe the board IS a class? what woud it do? would the updating of it go in a class or in the main program?
    # maybe update would be something like... board.update(current_board, start_pocket, num_tiles) 






##### MISC NOTES
# game end could be a checker that looks for one side of the board to be empty
